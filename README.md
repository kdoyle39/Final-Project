# Final-Project

The folder labeled "data" provides link and information about each dataset used in the code.

The "analysis" folder is broken into 3 seperate R terminals, one that contains the data only, one that contains the tables/figures only, and the main terminal which includes everything needed for replication.

    In order to successfully replicated the results, either main.R needs to be run or if using the other two than "data" must be run first.
